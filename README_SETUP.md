2. **Import path errors** - Fixed all import paths to use relative paths
3. **Missing UI components** - Created complete UI component library
4. **Missing entity classes** - Created API client classes for all entities
5. **Server setup** - Created Express.js server with JSON-based data storage
6. **Mixed framework issues** - Set up proper React + Vue configuration

### Development Notes
- Server uses in-memory storage (data resets on restart)
- Client proxies API calls to server automatically
- Hot reload enabled for both client and server
- All components are functional and ready for use

## Next Steps
1. Add more pages (Admissions, Finance, Academics, etc.)
2. Implement user authentication
3. Add data persistence (database)
4. Add more advanced features like file uploads
5. Deploy to production

The application is now fully functional with a working client-server connection!
